    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This rainbow trout recipe is very easy and tasty. One day, I came up with this recipe with the ingredients I had on hand, and my family loved it. It works with farmed or wild trout, takes very little time, and tastes lighter than ocean fish. I buy whole, gutted fish with heads and tails still on from the supermarket; make sure to choose very fresh trout.</p>
    <p>The key is to add water to the dish as instructed in the directions, which keeps the fish from drying out; add hot water as cold water can crack the baking dish. Serve with rice and veggies. It's light and delicious, but be careful of bones!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 teaspoons olive oil, divided</li>
      <li>2 whole rainbow trout, gutted and cleaned, heads and tails still on</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon dried dill weed</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
      <li>salt to taste</li>
      <li>1/2 a large onion, sliced</li>
      <li>2 thin slices lemon</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons hot water</li>
      <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish with 1 teaspoon olive oil.</li>
      <li>Place trout in the prepared baking dish and coat with remaining olive oil. Gather the seasoning ingredients.</li>
      <li>Season inside and outside of fish with dill, thyme, and salt. Stuff each fish with onion slices; grind pepper on top. Place 1 lemon slice on each fish.</li>
      <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes; add hot water to dish. Continue baking until fish flakes easily with a fork, about 10 minutes more.</li>
      <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
